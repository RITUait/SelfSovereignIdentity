# **A Primer Of Sorts**

Satoshi Nakamoto developed the now infamous Bitcoin back in 2008. More than the fascination it garnered among the traders of the dark market for the anonymity it provided, it's underlying technology, called the "Blockchain" found applications in various fields.

In the Bitcoin realm, it is a cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology. But that's not all that a blockchain is capable of. There is a sudden demand and interest in blockchain for the wide range of problems it is capable of solving; by disrupting the current structure of governance, banking, trading and even the Internet, as we know it.

But what even is, a **Blockchain**?

A cryptographically-secure shared ledger of information, that is distributed to every "node" in the network, accessed and updated regularly, with the consent of all the nodes. Picture a Google Doc, shared on every computer system in a network for collaboration and consensual updation.

To break down the technical jargon:

**Cryptographically-secure**: Uses cryptography methods like encryption, hashing and digital signatures to ensure that transactions are valid and remain tamper-proof.

**Shared ledger**: Decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered without subsequently changing the state of all blocks and resulting in conflicts in the network.

**Node**: A computer connected to the blockchain network gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the blockchain network. Hence, every node is both a client and a server, holding identical copies of the blockchain's state.

**Consent**: Nodes in a peer-to-peer network validate transactions by consensus, using mechanisms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.
