# **A Primer Of Sorts**

Satoshi Nakamoto developed the now infamous Bitcoin back in 2008. More than the fascination it garnered among the traders of the dark market for the anonymity it provided, it's underlying technology, called the "Blockchain" found applications in various fields.

In the Bitcoin realm, it is a cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology. But that's not all that a blockchain is capable of. There is a sudden demand and interest in blockchain for the wide range of problems it is capable of solving; by disrupting the current structure of governance, banking, trading and even the Internet, as we know it.

But what even is, a **Blockchain**?

A cryptographically-secure shared ledger of information, that is distributed to every "node" in the network, accessed and updated regularly, with the consent of all the nodes. Picture a Google Doc, shared on every computer system in a network for collaboration and consensual updation.

To break down the technical jargon:

**Cryptographically-secure**: Uses cryptography methods like encryption, hashing and digital signatures to ensure that transactions are valid and remain tamper-proof.

**Shared ledger**: Decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered without subsequently changing the state of all blocks and resulting in conflicts in the network.

**Node**: A computer connected to the blockchain network gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the blockchain network. Hence, every node is both a client and a server, holding identical copies of the blockchain's state.

**Consent**: Nodes in a peer-to-peer network validate transactions by consensus, using mechanisms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.

This is not a primer on how blockchain works, so you can read more on that topic here: <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-White-Paper>

Coming back to the part where we simply accepted the shocking fact that blockchain is capable of disrupting the present structure of the internet. Really? 
What does that mean? 
And why does the present structure need to be done away with anyway?

### **Data is the currency of our generation**

Currently, our main sources of information and resources are the bigwigs: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Google you get the drift. They're great services that all of us use and require everyday, however we use them at the cost of giving away personal information, on a daily basis, for the lack of other options.
Simply put, our data is being held hostage by these service providers.
I mean, would you rather protect your data and not use Facebook, or use Facebook and risk your data being submitted to these service providers? Do you even see a harm in the latter, what with everyone around you doing the same? No, right?

That's not all. Our data has become so centralized by these big service providers, we don't see the almost non-existent line between "owning" our data and "sharing" our data. We believe we let third-party applications "view" our data, but in reality, we're only superficially providing permissions to access our data.
Once we exchange control of our data to access their free services, we have given away our data to be used for purposes not told to us, or not intended by us. The control has been lost.
It's not a mere coincidence or even an instance of Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, that those shoes you added to your online shopping cart earlier, suddenly begin popping up everywhere.

As this trend progresses (which it is and will, until something is done about it), it gets harder for regular people to make money, because of the data being so extremely centralized. We would have to be a part of a big corporation in order to benefit from this data. It's crazy, how much power these corporations have.
